# High Performance TensorFlow On Azure

This repository contains hands-on labs that demonstrate best practices and patterns for running high performance TensorFlow workloads on Microsoft Azure.

The labs cover many topics, including:
- Running TensorFlow on Azure remote compute targets: Azure GPU VMs, Azure Batch AI clusters, FPGAs
- Parallel training on multi-GPU Azure VMs
- Distributed training on GPU clusters
- High performance inference on GPU clusters and FPGAs
- TensorFlow on Azure Databricks
- TensorFlow model operationalization in Azure Container Services, Azure Kubernetes Services, IoT Edge
- Tensorboard and Azure Machine Learning integration
